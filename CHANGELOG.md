## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-18

### Breaking Changes

- **`Config.Temperature` / `Request.Temperature` changed to `*float64`** — `nil` means "omit from wire" (use provider default). Previously `float64` with default `1.0`. Callers must use a pointer: `temp := 0.7; req.Temperature = &temp`. `DefaultConfig()` no longer sets `Temperature: 1.0` — it is `nil` (omitted).

- **`EstimateCost` signature changed** — Now accepts a single `CostInput` struct instead of `(model, inputTokens, outputTokens)`. The new struct includes `ThinkingTokens`, `CacheCreateTokens`, and `CacheReadTokens` for accurate cache-aware and thinking-aware pricing.

- **Unknown providers require `BaseURL`** — `NewClient` with an unrecognized provider name and no `BaseURL` now returns an error instead of silently defaulting to openai_compat with no endpoint. Set `BaseURL` for custom providers.

### Added

- **`CostInput` struct** — Holds all token types for accurate cost estimation: `InputTokens`, `OutputTokens`, `ThinkingTokens`, `CacheCreateTokens`, `CacheReadTokens`.

- **Cache pricing in `ModelInfo`** — New `CacheWritePricePer1M` and `CacheReadPricePer1M` fields. Populated for all Anthropic models (write = 1.25× input, read = 0.1× input per Anthropic docs). `EstimateCost` now includes cache token costs in its calculation.

- **`EstimateCost` thinking token support** — Thinking tokens (Gemini: separate from output) are priced at the output rate. Anthropic bundles thinking in `OutputTokens`, so `ThinkingTokens` is 0 for Anthropic — no double-counting.

### Fixed

- **Context length false positives** — Removed overly broad `"token limit"` and `"too many tokens"` patterns from `isContextLengthMessage()`. These matched rate-limit messages (e.g. "token limit temporarily reached"), causing `IsContextLength()` to misclassify them. Remaining patterns are specific: `"context length"`, `"context_length"`, `"maximum context"`, `"prompt is too long"`, `"input too long"`, `"request too large"`, `"token count exceeds"`.

- **Tool input overflow corrupted stream** — Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible adapters continued parsing after tool input exceeded `MaxToolInputBytes`, producing corrupted tool JSON. Now the stream terminates cleanly with an error on overflow instead of dropping deltas and continuing.

- **Gemini stream tool input unbounded** — Added explicit `MaxToolInputBytes` check in the Gemini streaming adapter for consistency with Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible adapters.

- **Circuit breaker callback panic crashed caller** — A panicking `OnStateChange` callback propagated to the caller. Now recovered with `slog.Error` logging.

- **Anthropic thinking temperature override logged at wrong level** — Changed from `slog.Debug` to `slog.Warn` when overriding user-requested temperature to 1.0 for extended thinking. A silent override of a user-specified parameter should be visible without enabling debug logging.

## [0.1.22] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **`Response.ThinkingTokens` / `StreamEvent.ThinkingTokens`** — Gemini models that think by default (gemini-2.5-*) report `thoughtsTokenCount` separately from `candidatesTokenCount`. This was previously parsed but discarded. Now exposed so callers can see the full token breakdown. Anthropic and OpenAI-compat bundle thinking tokens into `OutputTokens`; for those providers `ThinkingTokens` remains 0.
- **Logging middleware** now includes `tokens_thinking` when > 0, matching the pattern used for cache tokens.

## [0.1.21] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **Image/vision support for all 3 adapters** — `ContentImage` parts are now fully serialized to the correct wire format for Anthropic (inline `image` blocks with `source`), Gemini (`inlineData` parts), and OpenAI-compatible providers (content array with `image_url` data URIs). Previously all three adapters rejected image content with an error.
- **`ValidateImageSource()`** — exported validation function checks for nil source, empty data, unsupported media types (`image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `image/webp` allowed), and unsupported source types (only `base64`). Used by all adapters before serialization.
- **`NewImageMessage()`** — convenience constructor parallel to `NewTextMessage`, creates a single-image message from role, media type, and base64 data.
- **Anthropic `cache_control` on image blocks** — image content blocks respect `CacheControl: true` on `ContentPart`, adding `cache_control: {type: "ephemeral"}` to the wire format.

## [0.1.20] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- **Ollama reasoning field not parsed** — Ollama (Qwen3) uses `"reasoning"` instead of `"reasoning_content"` for thinking output. The OpenAI-compatible adapter now parses both field names in complete and streaming responses.
- **Gemini 2.5 thinking tokens starve maxOutputTokens** — Gemini 2.5 models think by default but do not support `thinkingConfig` — the API rejects it. Thinking tokens silently consume the `maxOutputTokens` budget, causing premature `MAX_TOKENS` truncation. The adapter now pads `maxOutputTokens` with a thinking overhead (4096 tokens, capped at model max) for models with intrinsic thinking.

### Changed

- **Gemini 2.5 models marked `Thinking: true`** — `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, and `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` now have the `Thinking` flag set in the model registry, reflecting their intrinsic chain-of-thought behavior.

## [0.1.19] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- **Gemini thinking content was lost or mixed into Content** — Gemini models that think by default (e.g. `gemini-2.5-flash`) return `thought: true` parts alongside content parts. The adapter now routes thought parts to `resp.Thinking` (non-streaming) and emits `EventThinking` events (streaming) instead of mixing them into `Content`. Also parses `thoughtsTokenCount` from usage metadata.
- **OpenAI-compat reasoning models returned empty Content** — Models like Qwen3 (`qwen3:4b`) return `reasoning_content` alongside `content` (which may be null). The adapter now parses `reasoning_content` into `resp.Thinking` (non-streaming) and emits `EventThinking` events (streaming). Null `content` no longer causes empty responses.

### Changed

- **Documentation** — README and ARCHITECTURE.md updated to reflect that all three adapters now parse thinking content from responses (Anthropic via `thinking` blocks, Gemini via `thought: true` parts, OpenAI-compat via `reasoning_content`).

## [0.1.18] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- **Mistral/Groq/Ollama reasoning models sent wrong max tokens parameter** — The OpenAI-compatible adapter used `max_completion_tokens` (and omitted temperature) for all reasoning models (`Thinking: true`), but this is an OpenAI/xAI-specific API quirk. Mistral (`mistral-small-2603`, `magistral-medium-2509`, `magistral-small-2509`), Groq (`deepseek-r1-distill-*`), and Ollama (`qwen3:*`, `deepseek-r1:*`) reasoning models use standard `max_tokens` and accept temperature. Now scoped to `info.Provider == "openai" || info.Provider == "xai"` only.

## [0.1.17] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **Acknowledgements section in README** — Reference to the [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/main/packages/ai) library and explanation that the name rho is a tribute (next Greek letter after pi).

## [0.1.16] - 2026-03-18

- **Gemini `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`** — Pricing corrected from $0/$0 to $0.25/$1.50. Added `ThoughtSignature: true` (required for all Gemini 3.x models).
- **Mistral `mistral-large-2512` pricing** — Corrected from $2/$6 to $0.50/$1.50. Context window corrected to 256K.
- **Mistral `magistral-medium-2509` pricing** — Corrected from $0.40/$2 to $2/$5. Context corrected from 40K to 128K.
- **Mistral `magistral-small-2509` pricing** — Corrected from $0.10/$0.30 to $0.50/$1.50. Context corrected from 32K to 128K.

- **Mistral context windows** — All models updated to match official docs (most were undersized).

### Changed

- **Default Mistral model** — Changed from `mistral-small-2506` to `mistral-small-2603` (Mistral Small 4).
- **`mistral-small` alias** — Now resolves to `mistral-small-2603` (was `mistral-small-2506`).
- **`devstral` alias** — Now resolves to `devstral-2512` (was invalid `devstral-small-2-25-12`).
- **`ministral` alias** — Now resolves to `ministral-8b-2512` (was invalid `ministral-3-8b-25-12`).

## [0.1.15] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **New models** — Grok 4.20, Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite, GPT 5.4, GPT 5.3, new LLM examples (cached interactions for Gemini/Anthropic, Go code review system prompt).
- **OpenAI reasoning model parameters** — Fixed parameter handling for reasoning models.

### Changed

- **Module path migration** — Migrated from `gitlab2024.bds421-cloud.com/bds421/rho/llm` to `github.com/bds421/rho-llm`.

## [0.1.14] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **Context caching support** — Anthropic inline caching (`cache_control`) and Gemini cached content references. New fields:
  - `ContentPart.CacheControl` — mark individual content blocks as cacheable (Anthropic)
  - `Request.SystemCacheControl` — cache the system prompt (Anthropic, sends structured content blocks with `cache_control: {type: "ephemeral"}`)
  - `Request.CachedContent` — reference a pre-created Gemini cache by name
  - `Tool.CacheControl` — mark tool definitions as cacheable (Anthropic)
  - `Response.CacheCreationTokens` / `Response.CacheReadTokens` — cache token usage from Anthropic
  - `StreamEvent.CacheCreationTokens` / `StreamEvent.CacheReadTokens` — cache token usage in streaming (Anthropic, Gemini)
  - `LoggingClient` logs `cache_write` and `cache_read` when > 0
  - OpenAI-compatible adapters silently ignore all cache fields (no API support)

### Fixed

- **OpenAI-compat stream: spurious error after successful completion** — The OpenAI-compatible adapter reported scanner errors even after the stream completed successfully (`finishReason != ""`). Unlike the Anthropic and Gemini adapters which had a `doneEmitted` guard, the OpenAI adapter would yield a trailing scanner error to the caller, causing the pool to spuriously mark profiles as failed. Now guarded by `finishReason == ""`, matching the other two adapters.

- **Circuit breaker `onStateChange` callback deadlock** — The `WithOnStateChange` callback was invoked while holding `cb.mu.Lock()`. Any callback that called back into the circuit breaker (e.g., `cb.State()`) would deadlock. Now the callback is invoked after releasing the lock via a `setStateLocked`/`fireCallback` split.

- **Circuit breaker + retry loop burned dead iterations** — When the circuit breaker was open, the retry loop would back off and `continue` for each remaining iteration, sleeping 1-8s per attempt without making any HTTP call. After a circuit trip, every request burned through all retry iterations doing nothing. Now `Complete` and `Stream` return `ErrCircuitOpen` immediately when the circuit is open, letting the circuit's own cooldown timer control recovery.

- **GPT-4.1 ContextWindow off by 1000** — `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, and `gpt-4.1-nano` had `ContextWindow: 1047576` instead of the correct `1048576` (1024 * 1024).

- **Double logging in pooled clients** — When `LogRequests: true` was set, each rotated inner client got its own `LoggingClient` wrapper, and the pool-level wrapper doubled the output. Now `LogRequests` is cleared on inner client configs and applied once at the pool level.

### Changed

- **`RetryPolicy.MaxRetries` removed** — This field was never read by any code path. The pool's retry count is determined by `HealthyCount()` clamped to `[3, 10]`. Removing prevents users from setting a value that silently has no effect.

- **`RetryPolicy` struct** — `BaseDelay`, `MaxDelay`, `Factor`, `Jitter` remain. `MaxRetries` is removed (see above).

- **Configurable retry policy** description in v0.1.13 changelog updated — `RetryPolicy` struct fields are `BaseDelay`, `MaxDelay`, `Factor`, `Jitter`.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **Circuit breaker** — 3-state machine (`closed → open → half-open`) that opens after a configurable threshold of consecutive failures, prevents request storms into degraded endpoints, and auto-recovers via probe requests after cooldown. Enabled by default (`CircuitThreshold: 5`, `CircuitCooldown: 30s`). Auth errors (401/403) do not trip the circuit — bad key ≠ broken endpoint. All methods are nil-safe and thread-safe. New file: `circuitbreaker.go`.

- **Configurable retry policy** — `RetryPolicy` struct with `BaseDelay`, `MaxDelay`, `Factor`, `Jitter`. `Config.RetryPolicy` overrides the default (1s base, 30s max, 2x factor, ±25% jitter). The `Backoff()` function remains backward-compatible. New file: `retrypolicy.go` (replaces `backoff.go`).

- **Configurable cooldowns** — `Config.CooldownRateLimit` (default 60s), `Config.CooldownOverload` (default 30s), `Config.CooldownDefault` (default 10s) replace hardcoded magic numbers. Exported constants: `DefaultCooldownRateLimit`, `DefaultCooldownOverload`, `DefaultCooldownDefault`, `DefaultCircuitThreshold`, `DefaultCircuitCooldown`.

- **Retry observability hook** — `Config.RetryHook` receives `RetryEvent` structs with typed events (`RetryAttemptFailed`, `RetryRotating`, `RetryBackingOff`, `RetryCircuitOpen`, `RetryExhausted`) for metrics, alerting, or debugging.

- **`MarkFailedByNameWithCooldown()`** — New method on `AuthPool` accepting explicit cooldown durations. Original `MarkFailedByName()` delegates to it with defaults.

### Changed

- **`DefaultConfig()` enables circuit breaker** — `CircuitThreshold: 5`, `CircuitCooldown: 30s`. All clients through `DefaultConfig()` or `NewClient()` benefit automatically.

- **`NewPooledClient` wires resilience from config** — Circuit breaker and retry hook are initialized from `Config` fields directly in `NewPooledClient`, not just in the factory path. Direct callers of `NewPooledClient` get the same behavior as `NewClient`.

### Removed

- **`backoff.go`** — Replaced by `retrypolicy.go`. The exported `Backoff()` function is preserved as a backward-compatible wrapper around `RetryPolicy.Delay()`.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **Gemini API 400 on empty text parts** — `ContentText` parts with empty strings (`""`) produced `geminiPart{Text: ""}` which serialized to `{}` due to the `omitempty` JSON tag. The Gemini API requires each part to have exactly one `data` oneof field set; an empty object violates this, returning: `"required oneof field 'data' must have one initialized field"`. Now empty text parts are skipped in both message content and system instructions. The existing `len(content.Parts) > 0` guard then drops messages that become entirely empty after filtering.

- **Anthropic and OpenAI adapters also sent empty text parts** — Same root cause across all three adapters. Anthropic sent `{"type":"text","text":""}` content blocks; OpenAI-compatible joined empty strings with `\n`, producing whitespace-only messages. Now all three adapters skip `ContentText` parts where `Text == ""` in every code path (system messages, user messages, assistant messages, tool-result-adjacent text).

## [0.1.11] - 2026-02-25

### Security

- **TLS 1.2+ minimum enforced** — `SafeHTTPClient` now sets `TLSClientConfig: &tls.Config{MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12}` on the HTTP transport. Defense-in-depth against TLS downgrade attacks, explicit rather than relying on Go runtime defaults.

- **`gosec` static analysis added to CI** — New `security` Makefile target runs `gosec -exclude=G117,G704 ./...`. G117 (secret field pattern) and G704 (SSRF taint) are excluded with documented justifications — both are inherent to an HTTP client library with `MarshalJSON` redaction. G404 (weak RNG) suppressed via `#nosec` on backoff jitter where crypto randomness is unnecessary.

- **`govulncheck` added to CI** — New `vulncheck` Makefile target runs `govulncheck ./...`. Both `security` and `vulncheck` targets are now part of `make ci`.

- **Config JSON redaction tests** — `TestConfigMarshalJSONRedactsAPIKey` and `TestAuthProfileMarshalJSONRedactsAPIKey` verify that `MarshalJSON` replaces API keys with "REDACTED" and that raw keys never appear in serialized output.

- **BaseURL scheme validation test** — `TestBaseURLSchemeValidation` verifies that `http://` and `https://` schemes work while `file://`, `javascript:`, `ftp://`, and `data:` schemes produce clear errors. Defense-in-depth against SSRF-adjacent misuse.

### Changed

- **Go 1.26 minimum** — `go.mod` upgraded from `go 1.23.4` to `go 1.26.0`. Resolves 15 known stdlib CVEs in crypto/tls, crypto/x509, net/http, and related packages that affected Go 1.23.x.

- **`DefaultTimeout` constant exported** — `llm.DefaultTimeout` (120s) is available for callers who want to reference the library's default HTTP timeout.

### Added

- **`ThoughtSignature` registry test** — `TestThoughtSignatureFlags` validates that `ThoughtSignature` is true only for Gemini 3.x models, false for older Gemini models, and false for all non-Gemini models. Prevents silent model registry corruption from reaching production.

### Fixed

- **`ThinkingLevel` silently ignored for OpenAI-compatible providers** — Setting `ThinkingLevel` on an OpenAI-compat provider (xAI, Groq, Cerebras, Mistral, OpenRouter, Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio) was silently dropped with no feedback. Now returns an explicit error: `"<provider> adapter does not support ThinkingLevel"`. ThinkingLevel is only supported by the `anthropic` and `gemini` adapters.

- **`PooledClient.Provider()` and `Model()` bypassed ref-counting** — Both methods accessed the underlying client directly without calling `Acquire()`/`Release()`, creating a race with `rotateClient()` which could close the client mid-call. Now uses the same Acquire/Release pattern as `Complete()` and `Stream()`.

- **`Config.Timeout` zero-value created unbounded HTTP client** — `NewClient(Config{...})` without an explicit `Timeout` created an HTTP client with no timeout, risking goroutine hangs on unresponsive endpoints. Now defaults to `DefaultTimeout` (120s) when `Timeout <= 0`.

- **Negative `MaxTokens` and `Temperature` accepted silently** — `newSingleClient()` passed negative values through to provider APIs, which returned opaque errors. Now validates early: `MaxTokens` and `Temperature` must be >= 0.

- **`maxRetries` unbounded for large auth pools** — `maxRetries = max(pool.Count(), 3)` scaled linearly with pool size. A 50-key pool allowed 50 retry attempts. Now capped at `maxRetryAttempts` (10) in both `Complete()` and `Stream()`.

- **`IsRetryable` false positives on `"request failed"` prefix** — The string fallback matched any error containing `"request failed"`, including non-retryable errors like `"request failed: 400 bad request"`. Removed. Added `"broken pipe"` to match connection resets by peer. In production, wrapped `net.Error` types trigger the type-based check path instead.

- **Anthropic stream scanner error inconsistency** — If the Anthropic SSE stream completed successfully (`message_delta` emitted) but the underlying reader returned a trailing error (e.g., connection close after EOF), the error was propagated to the caller despite the stream being complete. Now suppresses trailing scanner errors after `EventDone`, matching the Gemini adapter's behavior.

- **`NewAssistantMessage(nil)` panicked with opaque nil dereference** — Now panics with an explicit message: `"llm.NewAssistantMessage: resp must not be nil"`.

- **`ThinkingBudgetTokens` returned 4096 for `ThinkingNone`** — The default case returned 4096 instead of 0 when called with `ThinkingNone`. If ever called by mistake with the none level, it would silently produce a 4096-token thinking budget. Now returns 0.

- **"No healthy profiles" error inconsistent with `ErrNoAvailableProfiles`** — When all auth profiles were permanently disabled (e.g., by 401 errors), `AuthPool.GetAvailable()` returned a bare `fmt.Errorf` that did not wrap `ErrNoAvailableProfiles`. Callers using `errors.Is(err, ErrNoAvailableProfiles)` would not match. Now wraps `ErrNoAvailableProfiles` via `%w`.

- **Local providers had no retry/backoff** — `NewClient()` bypassed `PooledClient` for keyless providers (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio), giving them zero transient-error resilience. A single 502 from a local model server caused immediate failure. Now `NewClient()` always routes through `NewClientWithKeys()`, wrapping all providers — including keyless ones — in `PooledClient` for automatic retry with exponential backoff.

- **Adapter `Close()` leaked HTTP transport connections** — All three protocol adapters (`anthropic`, `gemini`, `openaicompat`) had no-op `Close()` methods that did not drain idle HTTP connections. During auth pool rotation, replaced clients left orphaned transport connections in the pool. Now `Close()` calls `httpClient.CloseIdleConnections()` to release them.

- **`make cover` under-reported provider sub-package coverage** — The `cover` Makefile target ran `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...` which only reports coverage for code within the same package as the test file. Tests in `llm_test.go` and `security_test.go` that exercise provider adapter code (via `httptest` servers) showed 0% for `provider/anthropic`, `provider/gemini`, and `provider/openaicompat`. Added `-coverpkg=./...` to enable cross-package coverage tracking.

- **`fmt.Errorf` non-constant format string** — `llm_test.go:1840` used `fmt.Errorf(tc.errMsg)` which Go 1.26's stricter vet rejects. Changed to `fmt.Errorf("%s", tc.errMsg)`.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **`TokensNotReported` constant** — Named sentinel (`-1`) for token counts when the provider did not report usage. Replaces magic `-1` literals in Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible stream parsers. Callers can compare `event.InputTokens == llm.TokensNotReported` instead of checking against a raw `-1`.

- **`Request.ThinkingBudget` field** — Custom token budget that overrides `ThinkingLevel` defaults when > 0. Allows per-request control over thinking budget without changing `ThinkingLevel` presets (e.g., `ThinkingBudget: 8192` with `ThinkingLevel: ThinkingMedium`).

- **`ErrClientClosed` sentinel error** — Returned by `PooledClient.Complete()` and `Stream()` when called after `Close()`. Replaces nil-pointer panic.

- **Type-based network error detection in `IsRetryable`** — Now checks `net.Error`, `io.EOF`, `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`, `syscall.ECONNRESET`, and `syscall.ECONNREFUSED` via `errors.As`/`errors.Is` before falling back to string matching. Strictly additive — all existing string-based detection preserved for backward compatibility.

- **3 new context-length error patterns** — `isContextLengthMessage` now matches `context_length` (underscore variant, Groq/OpenAI error codes), `input too long` (Gemini), and `request too large` (generic).

### Changed

- **Temperature override logging** — Anthropic adapter now emits a `slog.Debug` log when extended thinking forces `temperature = 1.0`, including the originally requested temperature. Previously silent.

### Fixed

- **BLOCKER: `t.Context()` broke Go 1.23 compilation** — `security_test.go` used `t.Context()` (Go 1.24+) in all 14 test call sites. Replaced with `context.Background()` to restore Go 1.23 compatibility.
- **BLOCKER: `ContentImage` silently dropped** — All three adapters silently ignored `ContentImage` parts in messages, causing data loss. Now returns a clear error: `"image content not yet supported by <provider> adapter"`.
- **Gemini hardcoded default model** — `gemini.New()` silently defaulted to `"gemini-2.0-flash"` when no model was provided, bypassing the factory's `ResolveModelAlias()` and inconsistent with anthropic/openaicompat. Removed; callers must set the model explicitly.
- **Panic on `Complete`/`Stream` after `Close`** — `PooledClient.Complete()` and `Stream()` would panic with nil pointer dereference if called after `Close()`. Now returns `ErrClientClosed`.
- **Missing model validation** — `newSingleClient()` accepted empty model strings, passing them to provider APIs which returned opaque errors. Now validates early: `"model is required"`.
- **OpenAI streaming missed zero-token usage** — Usage detection checked `PromptTokens > 0 || CompletionTokens > 0`, missing legitimate zero-token responses. Changed `Usage` to a pointer type — nil means absent, non-nil trusts the values including zero.
- **`Backoff()` returned zero on `delay=0`** — Guard only checked `delay < 0`; a zero delay (possible with very small base values) passed through. Changed to `delay <= 0`.
- **Documentation: thinking budget values** — README and ARCHITECTURE.md listed stale ThinkingLevel budgets (Low→1024, Medium→4096, High→16384). Corrected to match code: Low→4096, Medium→16384, High→65536.
- **Documentation: Gemini auth method** — ARCHITECTURE.md still described Gemini auth as `?key=` query parameter. Corrected to `x-goog-api-key` header (changed in v0.1.9).
- **Documentation: Ollama `mistral` alias** — README listed `mistral` as an Ollama alias but the actual alias is `mistral-local` (avoids collision with the Mistral provider name).
- **Internal codenames in comments** — Removed `RH/bds421` and `clawdbot/openclaw` references from `types.go` comments.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-02-22

### Security

- **Gemini API key moved from URL to header** — Previously sent as `?key=` query parameter, leaking into server logs, proxy logs, and HTTP referer headers. Now sent via `x-goog-api-key` header, matching other adapters' auth patterns.

- **Bounded error response reads** — All three adapters (`io.ReadAll` on error bodies) now use `io.LimitReader` capped at 1 MB. A malicious or broken endpoint returning a multi-GB error body previously caused OOM.

- **Error messages truncated at 4 KB** — `APIError.Message` is now capped to prevent unbounded strings from propagating through error chains, log systems, and serialization.

- **Redirect auth header stripping** — All HTTP clients now use `CheckRedirect` to strip sensitive headers (`Authorization`, `x-api-key`, `x-goog-api-key`) on cross-domain redirects. Previously, Anthropic's `x-api-key` and OpenAI's `Bearer` token would leak to a redirect target on a different host.

- **Smaller SSE scanner buffer** — Reduced from 1 MB to 256 KB per stream. Limits per-stream memory pressure from malicious endpoints sending oversized SSE lines.

- **Bounded success response body decoding** — `json.NewDecoder` on success response bodies now wraps `resp.Body` with `io.LimitReader` capped at 32 MB. Previously, a malicious endpoint returning a multi-GB JSON response caused OOM via unbounded `json.Decoder` allocation.

- **Bounded tool input accumulation in streams** — `inputBuffer` (Anthropic `input_json_delta`, OpenAI `function.arguments`) now capped at 1 MB. A malicious stream sending thousands of small fragments could previously accumulate without bound.

- **Malformed SSE events yield errors to callers** — Previously, `json.Unmarshal` failures on SSE events were silently logged and skipped (`continue`), causing data loss without the caller's knowledge. Now yielded as errors via the iterator, letting callers decide whether to continue or abort.

### Added

- **Security test suite** (`security_test.go`) — 15 tests verifying: Gemini header auth (Complete + Stream), error body truncation, bounded error reads, redirect header stripping (Gemini/Anthropic/OpenAI), bounded success body decoding (Gemini/Anthropic/OpenAI), bounded tool input accumulation (Anthropic/OpenAI), malformed SSE error propagation (Gemini/Anthropic/OpenAI).

- **`SafeHTTPClient(timeout)`** — Shared HTTP client constructor with redirect-safe auth header handling. Used by all three adapters.

- **`MaxErrorBodyBytes`** / **`MaxSSELineBytes`** / **`MaxResponseBodyBytes`** / **`MaxToolInputBytes`** constants — Centralized size limits for error reads (1 MB), SSE line parsing (256 KB), success response decoding (32 MB), and tool input accumulation (1 MB).

## [0.1.8] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **`NewAssistantMessage(resp)` constructor** — Creates an assistant message from a `Response`, preserving both text content and `tool_use` blocks (with `ThoughtSignature` for Gemini 3). Use this instead of `NewTextMessage(RoleAssistant, resp.Content)` in tool use loops — `NewTextMessage` drops tool call blocks, causing providers to reject the next request.

- **Groq model registry** — Added 6 Groq models: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, `openai/gpt-oss-20b`, `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b`, `deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b`. Default: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`. Aliases: `groq`, `llama`, `llama-70b`, `llama-8b`, `gpt-oss`.

- **Mistral model registry** — Added 8 Mistral models: `mistral-large-2512`, `mistral-medium-latest`, `mistral-small-2506`, `magistral-medium-2509`, `magistral-small-2509`, `codestral-2508`, `devstral-small-2-25-12`, `ministral-3-8b-25-12`. Default: `mistral-small-2506`. Aliases: `mistral-large`, `mistral-medium`, `mistral-small`, `magistral`, `codestral`, `devstral`, `ministral`.

### Fixed

- **Anthropic rejected `RoleSystem` messages** — The Anthropic adapter passed `role: "system"` messages in the `messages` array, which the API rejects. System messages are now extracted into the top-level `system` field (same pattern as the Gemini adapter).

- **StopReason values differed across providers** — Gemini returned `"STOP"` / `"FUNCTION_CALLING"` / `"MAX_TOKENS"`, OpenAI-compatible returned `"stop"` / `"tool_calls"` / `"length"`. Now all providers normalize to `"end_turn"` / `"tool_use"` / `"max_tokens"`. Anthropic already uses the normalized values natively.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **OpenAI model registry** — Added 16 OpenAI models to the model registry: GPT-5.2/5.1/5 (with `-chat-latest` variants), GPT-5 Mini/Nano, GPT-4.1/Mini/Nano, and O-series (o3, o3-mini, o4-mini). Includes default model (`gpt-5.2`), available models list, and aliases (`gpt`, `gpt5`, `gpt4.1`, etc.).

- **Grok reasoning model flags** — Added `Thinking: true` to `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` and `grok-4-fast-reasoning` in the model registry.

- **Registry thinking flag tests** — Added tests validating that `Thinking` and `SupportsThinking` flags are correctly set across all models in the registry.

### Fixed

- **`ProviderForModel()` returned empty for OpenAI models** — No OpenAI models were registered in the model registry, so provider auto-detection failed for any `gpt-*` or `o*` model ID.

- **`GetDefaultModel("openai")` returned `claude-sonnet-4-6`** — No `"openai"` entry in the `defaultModels` map caused the function to fall through to the hardcoded Anthropic fallback. Now returns `gpt-5.2`.

- **`LogRequests: true` produced no visible output** — `LoggingClient` logged request/response metadata at `slog.Debug` level, which is suppressed by the default `slog.Info` threshold. Users who explicitly opted in via `LogRequests: true` saw only the pool creation `Info` line, not the actual per-request metadata (provider, model, tokens, cost, elapsed). Changed success-path logs from `Debug` to `Info`.

- **`Config.ThinkingLevel` had no effect** — The Anthropic adapter only read `Request.ThinkingLevel`, ignoring the config-level setting documented in the README. Now `doRequest` and `doStreamRequest` fall back to `c.config.ThinkingLevel` when the per-request field is empty.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Per-profile BaseURL support** — Keys can now include a custom endpoint using the `API_KEY|BASE_URL` format. This enables failover across different backends (e.g., primary Anthropic API → Azure proxy → local vLLM fallback). The `clientFunc` callback now receives the full `AuthProfile` instead of just the API key string.

### Fixed

- **rotateClient() race condition** — Previously, `rotateClient()` called `Close()` on the old client after swapping. This raced with in-flight requests still using the old client reference. Current adapters' `Close()` is a no-op so this was latent, but would break if adapters ever did real cleanup. Now orphaned clients are garbage collected instead of explicitly closed.

- **Thundering herd on rotation** — When 50 goroutines hit a 429 simultaneously, all 50 would pass the "already rotated?" check (single-checked outside the lock), create 50 new HTTP clients, and queue up to overwrite `pc.client` 50 times. Now uses proper double-checked locking with a dedicated `rotateMu` mutex: goroutine 1 rotates while goroutines 2-50 block at the gate, then short-circuit when they see the rotation already happened.

- **Zero tokens indistinguishable from "not reported"** — OpenAI and Anthropic streaming parsers initialized token counts to 0. If a stream ended without a usage chunk (connection dropped, provider quirk), `EventDone` reported 0 tokens — indistinguishable from a legitimate zero-token response. Now token counts initialize to -1; callers can distinguish "not reported" (-1) from "zero tokens" (0).

- **Unflushed tool call on abrupt stream end** — If an OpenAI-compatible stream ended without `finish_reason` (network drop, spec-violating servers like Ollama dumping `[DONE]` without finish), any accumulated `currentToolCall` was silently lost. Now tool calls are flushed before emitting `EventDone`, regardless of whether `finish_reason` arrived.

### Changed

- `NewPooledClient` signature changed: `clientFunc` is now `func(profile AuthProfile) (Client, error)` instead of `func(apiKey string) (Client, error)`.

- `NewAuthPool` now parses keys with `|` separator: the portion before `|` is the API key, the portion after is the BaseURL. Keys without `|` work as before.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed

- **Critical: Auth error poison loop** — A single revoked API key (401/403) would permanently poison the `PooledClient`, causing 100% of subsequent requests to fail until process restart. The bug: auth errors returned early without calling `MarkFailed()` or `rotateClient()`, leaving the dead key active. Now auth errors trigger rotation to try other keys, and permanently disable the bad key (`IsHealthy = false`) instead of applying a temporary cooldown.

- **Critical: Single-key clients had no retry/backoff** — `NewClientWithKeys` with exactly 1 key bypassed `PooledClient` entirely, returning a raw adapter with zero retry logic. A transient 502/429 would fail immediately. Now single-key clients go through `PooledClient` and get the same exponential backoff (1s→2s→4s...) as multi-key pools.

- **Missing backoff on rotation failure** — When all keys were in cooldown, `PooledClient` gave up immediately instead of backing off. Now uses `Backoff()` with exponential delay (1-30s) and retries, respecting context cancellation. Minimum 3 retries for single-key resilience.

- **Parallel tool results truncated in OpenAI adapter** — When a user message contained multiple tool results (parallel tool execution), only the first was sent to OpenAI; the rest were silently dropped. This caused 400 Bad Request errors ("missing tool result for call_id"). Now each `ContentToolResult` in a message emits a separate `role: "tool"` message as OpenAI's format requires.

- **Auth errors wasted retries with dead keys** — When a 401/403 occurred and rotation failed (single-key pool or all keys revoked), the code would backoff and retry 3 times with the same dead key. Now auth errors return immediately when no healthy keys remain — backoff is only for transient errors (429, 503) where waiting helps.

- **OpenAI streaming never reported token usage** — Missing `stream_options: {include_usage: true}` in requests meant OpenAI/Groq/xAI streams never sent usage stats. Now set automatically for all streaming requests. Additionally, the parser was fixed to handle OpenAI's two-chunk format: `finish_reason` arrives in one chunk (with empty usage), then usage arrives in a separate chunk (with empty choices). The parser now accumulates state across chunks and emits `EventDone` with complete data after `[DONE]`.

- **Dead profiles corrupted cooldown calculation** — When finding the soonest available key, dead profiles (`IsHealthy=false`) with `Cooldown=ZeroTime` (year 0001) would be selected as "soonest," producing `time.Until()` results of -17 million hours. Now dead profiles are filtered out before comparing cooldowns. If all keys are permanently dead, returns a distinct error.

- **Retry loop ignored pool cooldowns** — When rotation failed due to cooldown, the retry loop used its own exponential backoff (1s→2s→4s) instead of the pool's authoritative wait time (e.g., 60s for rate limits). This caused the loop to blast the rate-limited API 3+ times during the penalty period. Now `GetAvailable()` returns a `CooldownError` with the exact wait duration, and the retry loop honors it.

- **`NewClient(cfg)` bypassed PooledClient** — Despite documentation claiming retry/backoff support, `NewClient(cfg)` passed `nil` to `NewClientWithKeys`, which fell through to `newSingleClient` (zero resilience). Now `NewClient(cfg)` injects `cfg.APIKey` into a single-element slice, routing through `PooledClient` for automatic retry.

### Changed

- `GetAvailable()` now returns `*CooldownError` (with `Wait` duration) instead of a formatted string error when all healthy keys are in cooldown. Callers can extract the exact wait time via `errors.As()`.

- Gemini adapter: synthetic tool call IDs now use `makeToolCallID()` helper, keeping format definition in one place with its inverse `resolveToolName()`.

- Scanner buffer allocation simplified across all adapters: removed wasteful pre-allocation, using `scanner.Buffer(nil, 1MB)` instead.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-02-21

### Changed

- **Breaking**: `Client.Stream` now returns `iter.Seq2[StreamEvent, error]` (Go 1.23 iterator) instead of taking a `StreamCallback` — callers use `for event, err := range client.Stream(ctx, req)` and `break` to abort cleanly; `defer resp.Body.Close()` inside the yield closure handles HTTP cleanup
- **Breaking**: `StreamCallback` type removed — replaced by the iterator pattern above
- **Breaking**: Introduced named string types for stringly-typed domains:
  - `type Role string` (`RoleUser`, `RoleAssistant`, `RoleSystem`) — replaces raw `string` on `Message.Role`
  - `type ContentType string` (`ContentText`, `ContentImage`, `ContentToolUse`, `ContentToolResult`) — replaces raw `string` on `ContentPart.Type`
  - `type EventType string` (`EventContent`, `EventToolUse`, `EventThinking`, `EventDone`, `EventError`) — replaces raw `string` on `StreamEvent.Type`
  - `type ThinkingLevel string` (`ThinkingNone`, `ThinkingLow`, `ThinkingMedium`, `ThinkingHigh`) — replaces raw `string` on `Request.ThinkingLevel`
- `NewTextMessage` first parameter changed from `string` to `Role` (untyped string literals still auto-convert)
- `ThinkingNone` is `""` (zero value) instead of `"none"` — simplifies checks to `req.ThinkingLevel != ThinkingNone`

### Fixed

- `PooledClient.Stream` now retries on **pre-data** connection failures (429, 503, etc.) — mirrors `Complete`'s rotation/backoff logic for errors that occur before any events are yielded to the caller; mid-stream errors still pass through immediately (retrying would duplicate content)
- **Data race fix**: `AuthPool.GetCurrent()` and `AuthPool.GetAvailable()` now return by value (`AuthProfile`, not `*AuthProfile`) — prevents callers from holding unprotected pointers to mutable pool state after the mutex unlocks
- **Global state corruption fix**: `GetAvailableModels()` now returns a copy of the internal slice — previously returned a direct reference, allowing callers to mutate the global registry array in place
- **Upstream DDoS fix**: `PooledClient.Complete` and `PooledClient.Stream` now return immediately when rotation fails (all profiles in cooldown) — previously ignored the pool's own cooldown state, waited 1s via exponential backoff, then fired a second request at the same rate-limited API key
- **Logging black hole fix**: `LoggingClient.Stream` "stream done" log is now in a `defer` — previously skipped entirely when the caller broke early from the iterator (`yield` returning false)
- Anthropic and Gemini adapters now respect `cfg.BaseURL` — previously hardcoded their endpoints, silently ignoring any override; `ResolveBaseURL()` is now called at construction time, consistent with the OpenAI-compat adapter
- `EventUsage` constant removed — was never emitted by any adapter (token usage arrives on `EventDone`); keeping it invited callers to write dead `case` branches
- `PooledClient.rotateClient()` now logs `Close()` errors on the replaced client instead of silently discarding them (`_ = oldClient.Close()` → `slog.Warn`)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-22

### Changed

- Renamed `ContentPart.Content` → `ContentPart.ToolResultContent` to eliminate naming confusion with `ContentPart.Text` (breaking change — both fields meant "the text content" but for different `Type` values; the new name makes the purpose unambiguous)
- JSON wire format unchanged (`"content"` tag preserved)
- `PooledClient.Stream` no longer retries on failure — streams cannot be safely retried because the callback may have already received partial events; retrying would silently duplicate content

### Fixed

- `Temperature: 0.0` is no longer silently omitted from API requests — removed `omitempty` from `Temperature float64` JSON tags in `Request` and all adapter request types (Go's `omitempty` treats 0.0 as empty, causing deterministic temperature to be sent as provider default)
- Anthropic streaming now reports token usage in `done` event — `InputTokens` captured from `message_start`, `OutputTokens` from `message_delta` (previously always 0, breaking cost estimation and logging)
- Anthropic streaming `StopReason` now correctly read from `delta.stop_reason` (was reading from non-existent `message.stop_reason`, always empty)
- Fixed 3 remaining `io.ReadAll` errors silently discarded in streaming error paths (inconsistent with non-streaming paths fixed in v0.1.2)
- `PooledClient.Complete` retry backoff now respects context cancellation — uses `select` with `ctx.Done()` instead of blocking `time.Sleep`
- Gemini tool call IDs are now unique — format changed from `call_<name>` to `call_<index>_<name>` so duplicate calls to the same tool get distinct IDs; `resolveToolName()` handles both formats

### Added

- Unit tests for `pool.go`: AuthPool (creation, empty pool, rotation, all-in-cooldown, mark success, status) and PooledClient (complete success, retry on retryable, no retry on non-retryable, stream no-retry, stream success, context cancellation, no keys, provider/model delegation, pool status) — 15 tests total

## [0.1.2] - 2026-02-22

### Changed

- Unexported all mutable package-level maps (`ModelRegistry`, `ModelAliases`, `DefaultModels`, `AvailableModels`, `Presets`) — accessed via read-only functions only
- Removed `sync.RWMutex` from `registry.go`, `provider.go`, `register.go` — data is immutable after init, no locking needed
- Removed dead `sync.RWMutex` fields from `openaicompat.Client` and `gemini.Client` (never used)
- Removed duplicate auth rotation from Anthropic adapter (`profiles`, `currentIndex`, `getNextProfile`) — `PooledClient` handles this
- Simplified `anthropic.Complete` / `anthropic.Stream` — direct calls, no retry loop
- License changed from MIT to Apache 2.0

### Fixed

- Fixed 14 swallowed errors across all 3 provider adapters:
  - 6x `io.ReadAll` errors silently discarded in error response paths — now logged via `slog.Warn`
  - 3x `json.Unmarshal` errors silently skipped in SSE stream parsing — now logged via `slog.Warn`
  - 4x `json.Unmarshal` errors silently discarded in tool input parsing — now logged + raw string preserved as fallback
  - 1x `json.Marshal` error silently discarded in tool input serialization — now logged + empty object fallback

### Added

- Read-only accessor functions: `GetModelInfo`, `GetDefaultModel`, `GetAvailableModels`, `ResolveModelAlias`, `ProviderForModel`, `PresetFor`

### Removed

- Exported maps: `Presets`, `ModelRegistry`, `DefaultModels`, `AvailableModels`, `ModelAliases` (breaking change — use accessor functions)
- `RegisterModel`, `RegisterAlias`, `RegisterPreset`, `AllPresets` (unnecessary write/copy functions for static data)
- `anthropic.Client.AuthProfiles` support (use `NewClientWithKeys` for multi-key rotation)
- Dead `ToolResult` type from `types.go` (never referenced)
- Dead `Config.Cooldown` field (pool uses hardcoded per-error-type cooldowns)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-10

### Changed

- Replaced `shared/logger` dependency with stdlib `log/slog` — zero external dependencies
- `LoggingClient` now stores `*slog.Logger` instead of string prefix
- Standalone module path: `github.com/bds421/rho-llm`

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- Provider adapters: Anthropic (native), Gemini (native), OpenAI-compatible (11+ providers)
- `database/sql`-style driver registration via `RegisterProvider` / `init()`
- Streaming with typed `StreamEvent` callbacks (content, tool_use, thinking, usage, done, error)
- Tool use / function calling across all three wire protocols
- Extended thinking support (Anthropic budget, Gemini ThoughtSignature)
- Auth pool rotation with per-profile cooldown (`PooledClient`)
- Structured errors: `APIError` with `IsRateLimited`, `IsOverloaded`, `IsRetryable`, `IsAuthError`, `IsContextLength`
- Exponential backoff with jitter (`Backoff`)
- Logging middleware (`LoggingClient`) -- metadata only, no message content
- Model registry with 65+ models, 23 short aliases, per-model pricing
- Cost estimation (`EstimateCost`)
- Zero external dependencies (stdlib only, `log/slog` for logging)
