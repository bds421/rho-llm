# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.11] - 2026-02-23

### Security

- **TLS 1.2+ minimum enforced** — `SafeHTTPClient` now sets `TLSClientConfig: &tls.Config{MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12}` on the HTTP transport. Defense-in-depth against TLS downgrade attacks, explicit rather than relying on Go runtime defaults.

- **`gosec` static analysis added to CI** — New `security` Makefile target runs `gosec -exclude=G117,G704 ./...`. G117 (secret field pattern) and G704 (SSRF taint) are excluded with documented justifications — both are inherent to an HTTP client library with `MarshalJSON` redaction. G404 (weak RNG) suppressed via `#nosec` on backoff jitter where crypto randomness is unnecessary.

- **`govulncheck` added to CI** — New `vulncheck` Makefile target runs `govulncheck ./...`. Both `security` and `vulncheck` targets are now part of `make ci`.

- **Config JSON redaction tests** — `TestConfigMarshalJSONRedactsAPIKey` and `TestAuthProfileMarshalJSONRedactsAPIKey` verify that `MarshalJSON` replaces API keys with "REDACTED" and that raw keys never appear in serialized output.

- **BaseURL scheme validation test** — `TestBaseURLSchemeValidation` verifies that `http://` and `https://` schemes work while `file://`, `javascript:`, `ftp://`, and `data:` schemes produce clear errors. Defense-in-depth against SSRF-adjacent misuse.

### Changed

- **Go 1.26 minimum** — `go.mod` upgraded from `go 1.23.4` to `go 1.26.0`. Resolves 15 known stdlib CVEs in crypto/tls, crypto/x509, net/http, and related packages that affected Go 1.23.x.

### Fixed

- **Local providers had no retry/backoff** — `NewClient()` bypassed `PooledClient` for keyless providers (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio), giving them zero transient-error resilience. A single 502 from a local model server caused immediate failure. Now `NewClient()` always routes through `NewClientWithKeys()`, wrapping all providers — including keyless ones — in `PooledClient` for automatic retry with exponential backoff.

- **Adapter `Close()` leaked HTTP transport connections** — All three protocol adapters (`anthropic`, `gemini`, `openaicompat`) had no-op `Close()` methods that did not drain idle HTTP connections. During auth pool rotation, replaced clients left orphaned transport connections in the pool. Now `Close()` calls `httpClient.CloseIdleConnections()` to release them.

- **`make cover` under-reported provider sub-package coverage** — The `cover` Makefile target ran `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...` which only reports coverage for code within the same package as the test file. Tests in `llm_test.go` and `security_test.go` that exercise provider adapter code (via `httptest` servers) showed 0% for `provider/anthropic`, `provider/gemini`, and `provider/openaicompat`. Added `-coverpkg=./...` to enable cross-package coverage tracking.

- **`fmt.Errorf` non-constant format string** — `llm_test.go:1840` used `fmt.Errorf(tc.errMsg)` which Go 1.26's stricter vet rejects. Changed to `fmt.Errorf("%s", tc.errMsg)`.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **`TokensNotReported` constant** — Named sentinel (`-1`) for token counts when the provider did not report usage. Replaces magic `-1` literals in Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible stream parsers. Callers can compare `event.InputTokens == llm.TokensNotReported` instead of checking against a raw `-1`.

- **`Request.ThinkingBudget` field** — Custom token budget that overrides `ThinkingLevel` defaults when > 0. Allows per-request control over thinking budget without changing `ThinkingLevel` presets (e.g., `ThinkingBudget: 8192` with `ThinkingLevel: ThinkingMedium`).

- **`ErrClientClosed` sentinel error** — Returned by `PooledClient.Complete()` and `Stream()` when called after `Close()`. Replaces nil-pointer panic.

- **Type-based network error detection in `IsRetryable`** — Now checks `net.Error`, `io.EOF`, `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`, `syscall.ECONNRESET`, and `syscall.ECONNREFUSED` via `errors.As`/`errors.Is` before falling back to string matching. Strictly additive — all existing string-based detection preserved for backward compatibility.

- **3 new context-length error patterns** — `isContextLengthMessage` now matches `context_length` (underscore variant, Groq/OpenAI error codes), `input too long` (Gemini), and `request too large` (generic).

### Changed

- **Temperature override logging** — Anthropic adapter now emits a `slog.Debug` log when extended thinking forces `temperature = 1.0`, including the originally requested temperature. Previously silent.

### Fixed

- **BLOCKER: `t.Context()` broke Go 1.23 compilation** — `security_test.go` used `t.Context()` (Go 1.24+) in all 14 test call sites. Replaced with `context.Background()` to restore Go 1.23 compatibility.
- **BLOCKER: `ContentImage` silently dropped** — All three adapters silently ignored `ContentImage` parts in messages, causing data loss. Now returns a clear error: `"image content not yet supported by <provider> adapter"`.
- **Gemini hardcoded default model** — `gemini.New()` silently defaulted to `"gemini-2.0-flash"` when no model was provided, bypassing the factory's `ResolveModelAlias()` and inconsistent with anthropic/openaicompat. Removed; callers must set the model explicitly.
- **Panic on `Complete`/`Stream` after `Close`** — `PooledClient.Complete()` and `Stream()` would panic with nil pointer dereference if called after `Close()`. Now returns `ErrClientClosed`.
- **Missing model validation** — `newSingleClient()` accepted empty model strings, passing them to provider APIs which returned opaque errors. Now validates early: `"model is required"`.
- **OpenAI streaming missed zero-token usage** — Usage detection checked `PromptTokens > 0 || CompletionTokens > 0`, missing legitimate zero-token responses. Changed `Usage` to a pointer type — nil means absent, non-nil trusts the values including zero.
- **`Backoff()` returned zero on `delay=0`** — Guard only checked `delay < 0`; a zero delay (possible with very small base values) passed through. Changed to `delay <= 0`.
- **Documentation: thinking budget values** — README and ARCHITECTURE.md listed stale ThinkingLevel budgets (Low→1024, Medium→4096, High→16384). Corrected to match code: Low→4096, Medium→16384, High→65536.
- **Documentation: Gemini auth method** — ARCHITECTURE.md still described Gemini auth as `?key=` query parameter. Corrected to `x-goog-api-key` header (changed in v0.1.9).
- **Documentation: Ollama `mistral` alias** — README listed `mistral` as an Ollama alias but the actual alias is `mistral-local` (avoids collision with the Mistral provider name).
- **Internal codenames in comments** — Removed `RH/bds421` and `clawdbot/openclaw` references from `types.go` comments.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-02-22

### Security

- **Gemini API key moved from URL to header** — Previously sent as `?key=` query parameter, leaking into server logs, proxy logs, and HTTP referer headers. Now sent via `x-goog-api-key` header, matching other adapters' auth patterns.

- **Bounded error response reads** — All three adapters (`io.ReadAll` on error bodies) now use `io.LimitReader` capped at 1 MB. A malicious or broken endpoint returning a multi-GB error body previously caused OOM.

- **Error messages truncated at 4 KB** — `APIError.Message` is now capped to prevent unbounded strings from propagating through error chains, log systems, and serialization.

- **Redirect auth header stripping** — All HTTP clients now use `CheckRedirect` to strip sensitive headers (`Authorization`, `x-api-key`, `x-goog-api-key`) on cross-domain redirects. Previously, Anthropic's `x-api-key` and OpenAI's `Bearer` token would leak to a redirect target on a different host.

- **Smaller SSE scanner buffer** — Reduced from 1 MB to 256 KB per stream. Limits per-stream memory pressure from malicious endpoints sending oversized SSE lines.

- **Bounded success response body decoding** — `json.NewDecoder` on success response bodies now wraps `resp.Body` with `io.LimitReader` capped at 32 MB. Previously, a malicious endpoint returning a multi-GB JSON response caused OOM via unbounded `json.Decoder` allocation.

- **Bounded tool input accumulation in streams** — `inputBuffer` (Anthropic `input_json_delta`, OpenAI `function.arguments`) now capped at 1 MB. A malicious stream sending thousands of small fragments could previously accumulate without bound.

- **Malformed SSE events yield errors to callers** — Previously, `json.Unmarshal` failures on SSE events were silently logged and skipped (`continue`), causing data loss without the caller's knowledge. Now yielded as errors via the iterator, letting callers decide whether to continue or abort.

### Added

- **Security test suite** (`security_test.go`) — 15 tests verifying: Gemini header auth (Complete + Stream), error body truncation, bounded error reads, redirect header stripping (Gemini/Anthropic/OpenAI), bounded success body decoding (Gemini/Anthropic/OpenAI), bounded tool input accumulation (Anthropic/OpenAI), malformed SSE error propagation (Gemini/Anthropic/OpenAI).

- **`SafeHTTPClient(timeout)`** — Shared HTTP client constructor with redirect-safe auth header handling. Used by all three adapters.

- **`MaxErrorBodyBytes`** / **`MaxSSELineBytes`** / **`MaxResponseBodyBytes`** / **`MaxToolInputBytes`** constants — Centralized size limits for error reads (1 MB), SSE line parsing (256 KB), success response decoding (32 MB), and tool input accumulation (1 MB).

## [0.1.8] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **`NewAssistantMessage(resp)` constructor** — Creates an assistant message from a `Response`, preserving both text content and `tool_use` blocks (with `ThoughtSignature` for Gemini 3). Use this instead of `NewTextMessage(RoleAssistant, resp.Content)` in tool use loops — `NewTextMessage` drops tool call blocks, causing providers to reject the next request.

- **Groq model registry** — Added 6 Groq models: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, `openai/gpt-oss-20b`, `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b`, `deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b`. Default: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`. Aliases: `groq`, `llama`, `llama-70b`, `llama-8b`, `gpt-oss`.

- **Mistral model registry** — Added 8 Mistral models: `mistral-large-2512`, `mistral-medium-latest`, `mistral-small-2506`, `magistral-medium-2509`, `magistral-small-2509`, `codestral-2508`, `devstral-small-2-25-12`, `ministral-3-8b-25-12`. Default: `mistral-small-2506`. Aliases: `mistral-large`, `mistral-medium`, `mistral-small`, `magistral`, `codestral`, `devstral`, `ministral`.

### Fixed

- **Anthropic rejected `RoleSystem` messages** — The Anthropic adapter passed `role: "system"` messages in the `messages` array, which the API rejects. System messages are now extracted into the top-level `system` field (same pattern as the Gemini adapter).

- **StopReason values differed across providers** — Gemini returned `"STOP"` / `"FUNCTION_CALLING"` / `"MAX_TOKENS"`, OpenAI-compatible returned `"stop"` / `"tool_calls"` / `"length"`. Now all providers normalize to `"end_turn"` / `"tool_use"` / `"max_tokens"`. Anthropic already uses the normalized values natively.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **OpenAI model registry** — Added 16 OpenAI models to the model registry: GPT-5.2/5.1/5 (with `-chat-latest` variants), GPT-5 Mini/Nano, GPT-4.1/Mini/Nano, and O-series (o3, o3-mini, o4-mini). Includes default model (`gpt-5.2`), available models list, and aliases (`gpt`, `gpt5`, `gpt4.1`, etc.).

- **Grok reasoning model flags** — Added `Thinking: true` to `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` and `grok-4-fast-reasoning` in the model registry.

- **Registry thinking flag tests** — Added tests validating that `Thinking` and `SupportsThinking` flags are correctly set across all models in the registry.

### Fixed

- **`ProviderForModel()` returned empty for OpenAI models** — No OpenAI models were registered in the model registry, so provider auto-detection failed for any `gpt-*` or `o*` model ID.

- **`GetDefaultModel("openai")` returned `claude-sonnet-4-6`** — No `"openai"` entry in the `defaultModels` map caused the function to fall through to the hardcoded Anthropic fallback. Now returns `gpt-5.2`.

- **`LogRequests: true` produced no visible output** — `LoggingClient` logged request/response metadata at `slog.Debug` level, which is suppressed by the default `slog.Info` threshold. Users who explicitly opted in via `LogRequests: true` saw only the pool creation `Info` line, not the actual per-request metadata (provider, model, tokens, cost, elapsed). Changed success-path logs from `Debug` to `Info`.

- **`Config.ThinkingLevel` had no effect** — The Anthropic adapter only read `Request.ThinkingLevel`, ignoring the config-level setting documented in the README. Now `doRequest` and `doStreamRequest` fall back to `c.config.ThinkingLevel` when the per-request field is empty.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Per-profile BaseURL support** — Keys can now include a custom endpoint using the `API_KEY|BASE_URL` format. This enables failover across different backends (e.g., primary Anthropic API → Azure proxy → local vLLM fallback). The `clientFunc` callback now receives the full `AuthProfile` instead of just the API key string.

### Fixed

- **rotateClient() race condition** — Previously, `rotateClient()` called `Close()` on the old client after swapping. This raced with in-flight requests still using the old client reference. Current adapters' `Close()` is a no-op so this was latent, but would break if adapters ever did real cleanup. Now orphaned clients are garbage collected instead of explicitly closed.

- **Thundering herd on rotation** — When 50 goroutines hit a 429 simultaneously, all 50 would pass the "already rotated?" check (single-checked outside the lock), create 50 new HTTP clients, and queue up to overwrite `pc.client` 50 times. Now uses proper double-checked locking with a dedicated `rotateMu` mutex: goroutine 1 rotates while goroutines 2-50 block at the gate, then short-circuit when they see the rotation already happened.

- **Zero tokens indistinguishable from "not reported"** — OpenAI and Anthropic streaming parsers initialized token counts to 0. If a stream ended without a usage chunk (connection dropped, provider quirk), `EventDone` reported 0 tokens — indistinguishable from a legitimate zero-token response. Now token counts initialize to -1; callers can distinguish "not reported" (-1) from "zero tokens" (0).

- **Unflushed tool call on abrupt stream end** — If an OpenAI-compatible stream ended without `finish_reason` (network drop, spec-violating servers like Ollama dumping `[DONE]` without finish), any accumulated `currentToolCall` was silently lost. Now tool calls are flushed before emitting `EventDone`, regardless of whether `finish_reason` arrived.

### Changed

- `NewPooledClient` signature changed: `clientFunc` is now `func(profile AuthProfile) (Client, error)` instead of `func(apiKey string) (Client, error)`.

- `NewAuthPool` now parses keys with `|` separator: the portion before `|` is the API key, the portion after is the BaseURL. Keys without `|` work as before.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed

- **Critical: Auth error poison loop** — A single revoked API key (401/403) would permanently poison the `PooledClient`, causing 100% of subsequent requests to fail until process restart. The bug: auth errors returned early without calling `MarkFailed()` or `rotateClient()`, leaving the dead key active. Now auth errors trigger rotation to try other keys, and permanently disable the bad key (`IsHealthy = false`) instead of applying a temporary cooldown.

- **Critical: Single-key clients had no retry/backoff** — `NewClientWithKeys` with exactly 1 key bypassed `PooledClient` entirely, returning a raw adapter with zero retry logic. A transient 502/429 would fail immediately. Now single-key clients go through `PooledClient` and get the same exponential backoff (1s→2s→4s...) as multi-key pools.

- **Missing backoff on rotation failure** — When all keys were in cooldown, `PooledClient` gave up immediately instead of backing off. Now uses `Backoff()` with exponential delay (1-30s) and retries, respecting context cancellation. Minimum 3 retries for single-key resilience.

- **Parallel tool results truncated in OpenAI adapter** — When a user message contained multiple tool results (parallel tool execution), only the first was sent to OpenAI; the rest were silently dropped. This caused 400 Bad Request errors ("missing tool result for call_id"). Now each `ContentToolResult` in a message emits a separate `role: "tool"` message as OpenAI's format requires.

- **Auth errors wasted retries with dead keys** — When a 401/403 occurred and rotation failed (single-key pool or all keys revoked), the code would backoff and retry 3 times with the same dead key. Now auth errors return immediately when no healthy keys remain — backoff is only for transient errors (429, 503) where waiting helps.

- **OpenAI streaming never reported token usage** — Missing `stream_options: {include_usage: true}` in requests meant OpenAI/Groq/xAI streams never sent usage stats. Now set automatically for all streaming requests. Additionally, the parser was fixed to handle OpenAI's two-chunk format: `finish_reason` arrives in one chunk (with empty usage), then usage arrives in a separate chunk (with empty choices). The parser now accumulates state across chunks and emits `EventDone` with complete data after `[DONE]`.

- **Dead profiles corrupted cooldown calculation** — When finding the soonest available key, dead profiles (`IsHealthy=false`) with `Cooldown=ZeroTime` (year 0001) would be selected as "soonest," producing `time.Until()` results of -17 million hours. Now dead profiles are filtered out before comparing cooldowns. If all keys are permanently dead, returns a distinct error.

- **Retry loop ignored pool cooldowns** — When rotation failed due to cooldown, the retry loop used its own exponential backoff (1s→2s→4s) instead of the pool's authoritative wait time (e.g., 60s for rate limits). This caused the loop to blast the rate-limited API 3+ times during the penalty period. Now `GetAvailable()` returns a `CooldownError` with the exact wait duration, and the retry loop honors it.

- **`NewClient(cfg)` bypassed PooledClient** — Despite documentation claiming retry/backoff support, `NewClient(cfg)` passed `nil` to `NewClientWithKeys`, which fell through to `newSingleClient` (zero resilience). Now `NewClient(cfg)` injects `cfg.APIKey` into a single-element slice, routing through `PooledClient` for automatic retry.

### Changed

- `GetAvailable()` now returns `*CooldownError` (with `Wait` duration) instead of a formatted string error when all healthy keys are in cooldown. Callers can extract the exact wait time via `errors.As()`.

- Gemini adapter: synthetic tool call IDs now use `makeToolCallID()` helper, keeping format definition in one place with its inverse `resolveToolName()`.

- Scanner buffer allocation simplified across all adapters: removed wasteful pre-allocation, using `scanner.Buffer(nil, 1MB)` instead.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-02-21

### Changed

- **Breaking**: `Client.Stream` now returns `iter.Seq2[StreamEvent, error]` (Go 1.23 iterator) instead of taking a `StreamCallback` — callers use `for event, err := range client.Stream(ctx, req)` and `break` to abort cleanly; `defer resp.Body.Close()` inside the yield closure handles HTTP cleanup
- **Breaking**: `StreamCallback` type removed — replaced by the iterator pattern above
- **Breaking**: Introduced named string types for stringly-typed domains:
  - `type Role string` (`RoleUser`, `RoleAssistant`, `RoleSystem`) — replaces raw `string` on `Message.Role`
  - `type ContentType string` (`ContentText`, `ContentImage`, `ContentToolUse`, `ContentToolResult`) — replaces raw `string` on `ContentPart.Type`
  - `type EventType string` (`EventContent`, `EventToolUse`, `EventThinking`, `EventDone`, `EventError`) — replaces raw `string` on `StreamEvent.Type`
  - `type ThinkingLevel string` (`ThinkingNone`, `ThinkingLow`, `ThinkingMedium`, `ThinkingHigh`) — replaces raw `string` on `Request.ThinkingLevel`
- `NewTextMessage` first parameter changed from `string` to `Role` (untyped string literals still auto-convert)
- `ThinkingNone` is `""` (zero value) instead of `"none"` — simplifies checks to `req.ThinkingLevel != ThinkingNone`

### Fixed

- `PooledClient.Stream` now retries on **pre-data** connection failures (429, 503, etc.) — mirrors `Complete`'s rotation/backoff logic for errors that occur before any events are yielded to the caller; mid-stream errors still pass through immediately (retrying would duplicate content)
- **Data race fix**: `AuthPool.GetCurrent()` and `AuthPool.GetAvailable()` now return by value (`AuthProfile`, not `*AuthProfile`) — prevents callers from holding unprotected pointers to mutable pool state after the mutex unlocks
- **Global state corruption fix**: `GetAvailableModels()` now returns a copy of the internal slice — previously returned a direct reference, allowing callers to mutate the global registry array in place
- **Upstream DDoS fix**: `PooledClient.Complete` and `PooledClient.Stream` now return immediately when rotation fails (all profiles in cooldown) — previously ignored the pool's own cooldown state, waited 1s via exponential backoff, then fired a second request at the same rate-limited API key
- **Logging black hole fix**: `LoggingClient.Stream` "stream done" log is now in a `defer` — previously skipped entirely when the caller broke early from the iterator (`yield` returning false)
- Anthropic and Gemini adapters now respect `cfg.BaseURL` — previously hardcoded their endpoints, silently ignoring any override; `ResolveBaseURL()` is now called at construction time, consistent with the OpenAI-compat adapter
- `EventUsage` constant removed — was never emitted by any adapter (token usage arrives on `EventDone`); keeping it invited callers to write dead `case` branches
- `PooledClient.rotateClient()` now logs `Close()` errors on the replaced client instead of silently discarding them (`_ = oldClient.Close()` → `slog.Warn`)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-22

### Changed

- Renamed `ContentPart.Content` → `ContentPart.ToolResultContent` to eliminate naming confusion with `ContentPart.Text` (breaking change — both fields meant "the text content" but for different `Type` values; the new name makes the purpose unambiguous)
- JSON wire format unchanged (`"content"` tag preserved)
- `PooledClient.Stream` no longer retries on failure — streams cannot be safely retried because the callback may have already received partial events; retrying would silently duplicate content

### Fixed

- `Temperature: 0.0` is no longer silently omitted from API requests — removed `omitempty` from `Temperature float64` JSON tags in `Request` and all adapter request types (Go's `omitempty` treats 0.0 as empty, causing deterministic temperature to be sent as provider default)
- Anthropic streaming now reports token usage in `done` event — `InputTokens` captured from `message_start`, `OutputTokens` from `message_delta` (previously always 0, breaking cost estimation and logging)
- Anthropic streaming `StopReason` now correctly read from `delta.stop_reason` (was reading from non-existent `message.stop_reason`, always empty)
- Fixed 3 remaining `io.ReadAll` errors silently discarded in streaming error paths (inconsistent with non-streaming paths fixed in v0.1.2)
- `PooledClient.Complete` retry backoff now respects context cancellation — uses `select` with `ctx.Done()` instead of blocking `time.Sleep`
- Gemini tool call IDs are now unique — format changed from `call_<name>` to `call_<index>_<name>` so duplicate calls to the same tool get distinct IDs; `resolveToolName()` handles both formats

### Added

- Unit tests for `pool.go`: AuthPool (creation, empty pool, rotation, all-in-cooldown, mark success, status) and PooledClient (complete success, retry on retryable, no retry on non-retryable, stream no-retry, stream success, context cancellation, no keys, provider/model delegation, pool status) — 15 tests total

## [0.1.2] - 2026-02-22

### Changed

- Unexported all mutable package-level maps (`ModelRegistry`, `ModelAliases`, `DefaultModels`, `AvailableModels`, `Presets`) — accessed via read-only functions only
- Removed `sync.RWMutex` from `registry.go`, `provider.go`, `register.go` — data is immutable after init, no locking needed
- Removed dead `sync.RWMutex` fields from `openaicompat.Client` and `gemini.Client` (never used)
- Removed duplicate auth rotation from Anthropic adapter (`profiles`, `currentIndex`, `getNextProfile`) — `PooledClient` handles this
- Simplified `anthropic.Complete` / `anthropic.Stream` — direct calls, no retry loop
- License changed from MIT to Apache 2.0

### Fixed

- Fixed 14 swallowed errors across all 3 provider adapters:
  - 6x `io.ReadAll` errors silently discarded in error response paths — now logged via `slog.Warn`
  - 3x `json.Unmarshal` errors silently skipped in SSE stream parsing — now logged via `slog.Warn`
  - 4x `json.Unmarshal` errors silently discarded in tool input parsing — now logged + raw string preserved as fallback
  - 1x `json.Marshal` error silently discarded in tool input serialization — now logged + empty object fallback

### Added

- Read-only accessor functions: `GetModelInfo`, `GetDefaultModel`, `GetAvailableModels`, `ResolveModelAlias`, `ProviderForModel`, `PresetFor`

### Removed

- Exported maps: `Presets`, `ModelRegistry`, `DefaultModels`, `AvailableModels`, `ModelAliases` (breaking change — use accessor functions)
- `RegisterModel`, `RegisterAlias`, `RegisterPreset`, `AllPresets` (unnecessary write/copy functions for static data)
- `anthropic.Client.AuthProfiles` support (use `NewClientWithKeys` for multi-key rotation)
- Dead `ToolResult` type from `types.go` (never referenced)
- Dead `Config.Cooldown` field (pool uses hardcoded per-error-type cooldowns)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-10

### Changed

- Replaced `shared/logger` dependency with stdlib `log/slog` — zero external dependencies
- `LoggingClient` now stores `*slog.Logger` instead of string prefix
- Standalone module path: `gitlab2024.bds421-cloud.com/bds421/rho/llm`

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-30

- Provider adapters: Anthropic (native), Gemini (native), OpenAI-compatible (11+ providers)
- `database/sql`-style driver registration via `RegisterProvider` / `init()`
- Streaming with typed `StreamEvent` callbacks (content, tool_use, thinking, usage, done, error)
- Tool use / function calling across all three wire protocols
- Extended thinking support (Anthropic budget, Gemini ThoughtSignature)
- Auth pool rotation with per-profile cooldown (`PooledClient`)
- Structured errors: `APIError` with `IsRateLimited`, `IsOverloaded`, `IsRetryable`, `IsAuthError`, `IsContextLength`
- Exponential backoff with jitter (`Backoff`)
- Logging middleware (`LoggingClient`) -- metadata only, no message content
- Model registry with 65+ models, 23 short aliases, per-model pricing
- Cost estimation (`EstimateCost`)
- Zero external dependencies (stdlib only, `log/slog` for logging)
